{{< /columns >}}

I am a medical student at Stanford and aim to advance medicine through innovation and engineering.

I first learned to code to build autonomous LEGO robots and was hooked. From there I modified video games, played with web development, built a 3D printer, and built/raced/crashed quadcopters. It wasn't long before I found myself in college studying some mix of computer science, data science, and computational neuroscience. Although I had a inclincation towards medicine, it wasn't until I realized that I could merge my passion for CS/engineering and medicine that I found my true calling.

I am interested in the applications of a number of emerging technologies and fields in medicine ranging from AI/ML, 3D printing, AR/VR, drones, and space medicine. [Get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devathu/) if you find my work interesting!
